# Blender-Isometric-Renderer
Render 3D animations as 2D sprites in 4, 8, or 16 directions.

1. Set up camera and lighting to your liking. For a proper isometric perspective set the camera's x rotation to 60 degrees. Make sure the camera's z is set to 0 before you hit render.

2. Make sure both the lighting and camera are selected. You can hit the rotate button to make sure the camera is rotating around the object properly.

3. Hit render.
